QUESTION:-
Given an unsorted integer array nums. Return the smallest positive integer that is not present in nums.
You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) auxiliary space.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: The numbers in the range [1,2] are all in the array.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 is in the array but 2 is missing.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest positive integer 1 is missing.

CODE:-
class Solution {
    public int firstMissingPositive(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            while (nums[i] > 0 && nums[i] <= n && nums[nums[i] - 1] != nums[i]) {
                int temp = nums[nums[i] - 1];
                nums[nums[i] - 1] = nums[i];
                nums[i] = temp;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != i + 1) {
                return i + 1;
            }
        }
        return n + 1;
    }
}

EXPLANATION:-
1.First Loop (Rearranging): We try to place each element in its correct position (i.e., if the element is x, it should be at index x-1). This is done by repeatedly swapping elements into their correct positions.
2.Second Loop (Finding the Missing Positive): After the rearrangement, we simply check for the first index i where nums[i] != i + 1. This index will give us the smallest missing positive integer.
3.Edge Case: If all numbers from 1 to n are present, the missing number is n + 1.
